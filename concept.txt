Brod Net concept
================

The network is going to cover two modes of operation.

1. Mesh network
2. Owerlay network

Discovery
---------

The node finds its peers by sending a local area broadcasts (LAND). It is 
performed by sending ASK-ST packet to all devices in range of all network 
interfaces.

The second mode of discovery is wide area node discovery (WAND). It is 
performed by sending an ASK-ND packet to all peers in node list. The node 
then tryies to send ASK-ST packet to theese nodes directly. If successfull 
(eg: in Internet), it uses them as peers. If unsuccessfull (eg: in 
Meshnet), it updates its routing table.
