Brod Net concept
================

The network is going to cover two modes of operation.

1. Mesh network
2. Owerlay network

And should serve the following

1. Name Verifiable Files
2. Updateable LiNks
3. KeyWord Searches
4. MeSsaGes

Discovery
---------

The node finds its peers by sending a local area broadcasts (LAND). It is 
performed by sending ASK-ST packet to all devices in range of all network 
interfaces.

The second mode of discovery is wide area node discovery (WAND). It is 
performed by sending an ASK-ND packet to all peers in node list. The node 
then tryies to send ASK-ST packet to theese nodes directly. If successfull 
(eg: in Internet), it uses them as peers. If unsuccessfull (eg: in 
Meshnet), it updates its routing table.

Areas
-----

Each node has an area record. A node can find its area record from its 
peers. The area record is used to accelerate routing.

The area record is just list of area codes. An area code is 32bit 
number and specifies a geological or fictional location of the node.
There are usually more area codes in area record of a given node.

When there are too much nodes in an area, new area should be created. When 
there are too litle nodes in area, the area code is abadoned.

The area codes could be possibly created and managed autmomatically, but 
now they are managed by administrator.

INet
-----

Xinetd is going to listen for all connections.
